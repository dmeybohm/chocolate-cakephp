## Chocolate CakePHP

This plugin improves support for the CakePHP frameworks in PhpStorm / IntelliJ Ultimate.

It adds the ability to navigate to the dynamic classes (controllers, views, models, components, and view helpers).
 
It adds a gutter icon in controller methods if the plugin finds an associated view file.
